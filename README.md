**HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-DATA-MODELLING**


**INTRODUCTION**

**Overview**

Heart/cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. Some risk factors for cvds cannot be controlled, like age or genetic factors, but lifestyle (diet, tobacco use etc) can play a major role in increasing the risk because of how various body systems are affected. The world health organization reports that in 2019, about 32% of global deaths were caused by heart diseases. These statistics highlight why combating cardiovascular disease should be prioritized.

***Defining our question***

Determining whether or not the patient has heart disease


***Metrics for success***

Visualising the relationships between the presence/absence of heart disease and various clinical features such as age, cholesterol level, resting ecg results etc.
Building a model that can determine whether someone has heart disease or not.
Identifying the top features influencing the presence/absence of heart disease.


***Understanding context***

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease



***Recording experimental design***

Determine the main objectives
Load and preview the dataset.
Understand the data.
Prepare the dataset - Identify outliers, anomalies, duplicates, missing values, and determine how deal with them etc.
Carry out univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and modelling.
Challenge the solution.
Conclusion and recommendations


***Relevance of data***

The provided data was appropriate for descriptive and classification analysis that was needed.

***Term Explanations***

***Electrocardiogram (ECG)***


A test that can be used to check the heart's rhythm and electrical activity image.png

P - wave: atrial depolarization (initiates atrial contraction)

QRS complex: represents ventricular depolarization (initiates contraction of ventricles)

T-wave: ventricular repolarization ( initiates ventricular relaxation)

ST segment: portion of the ECG from the end of the QRS complex to the beginning of the T wave. The ST segment normally remains isoelectric

**Angina**


Type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart

The most common cause of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is coronary artery disease (CAD).

Typical/classic angina refers to substernal chest pain or discomfort that is (2) Provoked by exertion or emotional stress and (3) relieved by rest or nitroglycerine (or both).

Atypical/probable anginal chest pain applies when 2 out of 3 criteria of classic angina are present.

Non anginal pain -recurring pain in your chest — typically, behind your breast bone and near your heart — that is not related to your heart.

Asymptomatic- temporary alteration in blood flow through the heart in the absence of chest pain or the usual anginal equivalents.
